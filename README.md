To ensure your machine has the required packages for commit lint and semantic release, run "npm install" within the .semantics/ folder before starting to commit code in this project. To release a new version of the application, run the command: "npm run semantic-release" within the .semantics/ folder on the "main" branch. It will search for commits with messages containing 'fix' (0.0.X), 'feat' (0.X.0), 'perf' (X.0.0), or 'BREAKING CHANGE' (X.0.0)" in the commit message, and it will increment the version at the position X respectively. Most commits will be one of the following (until you have a feature working): [build, chore, ci, docs, refactor, style, test]. The commits must be in all lowercase. Visit [Commit Lint Documentation](https://commitlint.js.org/#/?id=test) for more details.
